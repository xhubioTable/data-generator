== Generator Interface

This interface defines the core methods that every data generator must support to integrate seamlessly into the system. It establishes a contract for managing persistent state, generating data, and handling post-processing tasks.

=== Methods Overview

==== async loadStore()
* **Purpose:** Loads the generator's persistent state.
* **Details:**  
  Implement this method to restore the generator’s stored data (e.g., unique values, instance-specific data) from a persistent medium before new data is generated.

==== async saveStore()
* **Purpose:** Saves the current state of the generator.
* **Details:**  
  Implement this method to persist the generator’s current state (e.g., caching unique values or instance data) to a storage medium, ensuring consistency across invocations.

==== getGenerator(generatorName)
* **Purpose:** Retrieves a data generator by its registered name.
* **Returns:** The data generator associated with the specified name.
* **Throws:** An exception if no generator is found with the given name.

==== clearContext()
* **Purpose:** Clears the internal context.
* **Details:**  
  Resets internal properties such as `uniqueSet` and `instanceData` to remove any cached or temporary data, ensuring a fresh state for new operations.

==== async generate(instanceId, testcase, todoGenerator)
* **Purpose:** Generates data for a given test case.
* **Details:**  
  This is the primary method for data generation. It should return the generated data or `undefined` if generation cannot be completed—typically due to missing dependencies or data that is not yet available.

==== async createPostProcessTodos(instanceId, testcase, todoGenerator)
* **Purpose:** Creates post-processing tasks (todos) for additional operations after data generation.
* **Details:**  
  Implement this method if the generator needs to schedule further processing steps (e.g., to resolve dependencies between generated data) after the main data generation phase.

==== async postProcess(instanceId, testcase, todoGenerator)
* **Purpose:** Executes post-processing steps on the generated data.
* **Details:**  
  Use this method to perform any necessary final operations, such as validation, transformation, or cleanup, after all primary data generation is complete.

=== Summary

The Generator Interface sets the standard for data generators by specifying methods for loading and saving persistent state, generating data, and handling post-processing. Proper implementation of these methods is crucial for ensuring consistent, reliable data generation and integration within the system.
