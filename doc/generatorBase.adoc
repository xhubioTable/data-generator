== Data Generator Base

The Data Generator Base provides a default implementation of the data generator interface as defined in `DataGeneratorBase.js`. It handles common functionalities such as persistent storage, instance-specific data management via an instance ID, and ensuring unique generated values when required.

=== Key Features

* **Persistent Storage:**  
  Implements `loadStore()` and `saveStore()` methods to manage the generator's state persistently.
* **Instance Management:**  
  Uses an `instanceId` to ensure that repeated calls with the same identifier return the same generated data.
* **Unique Value Handling:**  
  Maintains a unique set of values to ensure uniqueness when the generator is configured for unique output.
* **Custom Data Generation:**  
  Introduces an abstract method `_doGenerate()` that must be overridden by subclasses to implement the specific logic for generating data.

=== Methods Overview

* **loadStore():**  
  Loads the stored generator data (unique values and instance-specific data) from persistent storage.
  
* **saveStore():**  
  Persists the current state of the generator data to a storage file.

* **getStoreData():**  
  Returns an object representing the current data that would be saved, including unique values and instance data.

* **generate(request):**  
  Returns the generated data for a given test case instance. If data for the specified instance ID already exists, it is returned immediately. Otherwise, it delegates data generation to the `_doGenerate()` method.

* **_doGenerate(request):**  
  Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses. This method contains the custom logic for data generation and should not modify test case data directly.

=== How to Extend the Data Generator Base

To create a custom data generator, follow these steps:
1. **Subclass the Base:**  
   Create a new class that extends `DataGeneratorBase`.
2. **Override _doGenerate():**  
   Implement the `doGenerate()` method with your custom data generation logic.
3. **Optional – Utilize Persistence:**  
   If your generator needs to persist state, use the built-in `loadStore()` and `saveStore()` methods.

For example:

[source,typescript]
----
class CustomDataGenerator extends DataGeneratorBase {
  protected async doGenerate(request: DataGeneratorGenerateRequest): Promise<any> {
    // Implement custom data generation logic here
    return { generated: "data" }
  }
}
----

=== Summary

The Data Generator Base streamlines the process of building new data generators by handling common tasks such as persistence, instance management, and unique value enforcement. Ensure to override the `doGenerate()` method in your subclasses to define the generator’s specific behavior.
