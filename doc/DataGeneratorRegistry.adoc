== Data Generator Registry

The Data Generator Registry is a centralized service that manages all available data generators for the processor. To utilize a generator, it must first be registered in this registry.

=== Registry Methods

==== registerGenerator(serviceName, generator)
Registers a data generator under the specified service name. This registration makes the generator available for use by the processor.

* **Parameters:**
  * `serviceName` - A unique identifier for the generator.
  * `generator` - The generator instance to be registered.

==== getGenerator(serviceName)
Retrieves the data generator associated with the specified service name. If no generator is found for the given name, the function throws an error.

* **Parameters:**
  * `serviceName` - The unique identifier for the generator.
* **Returns:**
  * The generator instance associated with the given service name.

==== async loadStore()
Invokes the `loadStore()` method on each registered generator asynchronously. This method is used to load or initialize the persisted state for every generator.

==== async saveStore()
Invokes the `saveStore()` method on each registered generator asynchronously. This method is responsible for persisting the current state of every generator.
